     <p>Hello! My name is Savannah Mattia I am currently reaching the end of my second 
     year at Rochester Institute of Technology and am a Human-Centered Computing major. 
     I enjoy psychology, graphic design, web development, UX/UI design, and trying to 
     solve problems. I am currently looking for a co-op either in the summer from May to 
     August or in the fall from August to December. I am thoroughly excited to go on co-op 
     and be able to implement what I've learned through classes as well as continue to 
     learn more while there. I am diligent, hard-working, and while working if I do not 
     know how to do something I'll be excited to learn how. </p>
     
     <p>There is a link to email me at the bottom of the page throughout this website, 
     however, the email address, as well as my phone number, are in my resume.</p>

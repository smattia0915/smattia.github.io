   		  <p>For this project we had multiple different people with multiple different 
   		  rolls. Everyone worked on content and general set up. Everyone had different roles for this project
   		   I was the graphic designer, I created the logo, 
   		  picked the color scheme and designed the layouts of the website. </p>

   		 <p>I first made an initial layout and checked back with my team for feedback.
   		  Once I got the okay I made multiple different color scheme designs with that 
   		  template and started looking testing different ideas for logos. We chose GREATS 
   		  for our group name because that was an acronym of all of our first names, and 
   		  since we were “great” I chose colors that and a logo that seemed more like a 
   		  crown, or gold, silver and bronze colors similar to medal placements in competitions. </p>

   		 <p>We chose the silver and cold colors, then the design became this:</p>
   		 
   		 <fig>
   		 <img src="assets/media/unix/HomeDesk.jpg" alt="Wireframe Home Desktop" width="700px">
   		 <img src="assets/media/unix/WireGold.jpg" alt="Wireframe Home Phone" height="450px">
   		 </sfig>
   		 
   		 <p>This was initially a full working website that was meant to aid students in learning 
   		 UNIX no matter the skill level, there were quizzes, information pages, and libraries for different terms and 
   		 keywords for UNIX</p>
   		 
   		 <p>Sadly however due to this being a group project through the college the website was
   		 only temporary and is no longer functioning. </p>

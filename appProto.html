	<h2>Projects - App Prototype:</h2>
   
   		<p>This project you were meant to design an app to be able to do the functionality
   		of your choosing, without fully implementing it. I created a traveling app.
   		This app is meant to aid in planning trips, this is not meant for booking flights or hotels. 
   		The app will automatically give the most popular visiting spots currently but there 
   		is also a search bar. I called it "Adventures Await". <br/> This was my logo that I created</p>
   		
   		<img class="progress" src="assets/media/appProto/Acompass.png" alt="logo" height="300px">
   		
   		<p>First you had to draw a few sketches
   		to get the main ideas out.</p>
   		
   		 <img class="progress" src="assets/media/appProto/sketches.jpeg" alt="Sketches" height="500px">
   		 
   		 <p>Then you had to make wireframes of the main pages and a few extra pages.After 
   		 you made the wireframes you put them in InVision to make it work as if
   		 it were a real app and ask three people to do a few tasks and give critiques. 
   		 When testing mine it was suggested that I add a search bar. They also thought 
   		 icons would look nicer for the dashboard. </p>
   		 
   		 <a class="normal" href="https://invis.io/UCQJV54MRZ8">Wireframe InVision</a>
   		 
   		 <p>Third you added a meaningful color scheme and pictures to make it more detailed, as
   		 well as create enough pages for there to be a full sequence. Blue represents calm, 
   		 tranquility and peace, and vacations and trips are meant to be peaceful and an 
   		 escape from our stressful lives. Purple represents luxury and mystery, vacations 
   		 are often luxurious and adventures are meant to be finding somewhere new or 
   		 something that is a mystery to you. </p>

   		 <img  src="assets/media/appProto/settings.png" alt="settings" height="500px">
   		 </figure>
   		  <p>Then you once again put these into InVision.</p>

   		  <br/>
   		  <p>I made the logo, however all photos for places were from unsplash. The icons 
   		  were found randomly on google, but were then edited by myself. All links for 
   		  information and images used are cited in references. The pages for the app
   		  were made using ninjamock and the logo and icons were created or edited in photoshop.</p>
